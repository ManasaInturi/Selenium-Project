# Selenium-Project

**Introduction:**
This Test Automation Framework is created using Java + Selenium Web Driver + TestNG. Which can be used across different web based applications. In this approach, the endeavor is to build a lot of applications independent reusable keyword components so that they can directly used for another web application without spending any extra effort. With this framework in place, whenever we need to automate a web based application, we would not need to start from scratch, but use the application independent keyword components to the extent possible and create application specific components for the specific needs.

**Prerequisites:**
Java jdk-1.8 or higher
Apache Maven 3 or higher
TestNG
Selenium libraries

**Execution:**
- Execute through mvn commands

getScreenshot() is used to indicates driver to capture a screenshot and store it in framework
